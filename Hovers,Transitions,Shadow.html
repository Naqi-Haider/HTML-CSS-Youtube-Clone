<!--Now in this case we use transitions, hovers, and shadows for effects.
 .class-Name ":" and hover "keyword" and Making this class structure As "Pseudo-Class".
 When we move our cursor to subscribe it will apply the additional effects to the already 
 class-made button so it will apply its attribute also without any change in the previous ones-->

<!-- Hover: activates when you move your cursor to the button-->
<!-- Active: activates when you click the button -->
<!-- Opacity: It fades the element which in this case is a button in hover transition::
    It accepts the value between 0 (Full fade) and 1 (No fade).-->

<!-- To reverse the effect when you hover over a button just simply replace the color of text with background color and vice-versa-->
<!-- Now for smooth appearance of effects such as opacity and color-changing we will use::
  "Transition": Accepts two values; 
  1st one is which effect you want to apply on (in this case is opacity)
  2nd one is how long you want to apply that transition will take like in seconds (1s,2s,2.5s...) and so on.-->

<!-- Also You can apply the transition effect on multiple things such as in join button you can see that::
  transition for background-color and then font (color) both seperated by "," and have different or same times!-->

<!-- Transition property should be base css style class not in hover or in active!-->
<!-- "box-shadow" is used for applying shadow effect. 
  It takes four values::
  1st value-> Horizontal pixel (right or along)
  2nd value-> Vertical pixel (Down or beneath)
  3rd value-> Blur pixel
  4th value-> Color (Shadow color) 
  Usually the shadows are not type of any color so we use "rgba" in this in which red,green,blue and 4th a means the opacity of shadow (how see-through it is)
  rgba takes 4 values -> red,green,blue and opacity which is basically less than zero in rgb is set to black .
  So, in this case we apply box-shadow inside hover to apply its effect only when we hover over the button. But transition will be applied in base css style as said!-->
<!-- Another way of assigning color is "hex" normally found in dev-tools in web-page.
  You can normally put that hex in "hex to rgb" calculator to find the exact numbers of red,green and blue.-->
<!-- Computed tab in dev-tools shows the final values of every element and its attributes!-->
<!-- CSS box model provides you much convinient feature such as "padding". height and width of a button is just for button layout but if we put much lengthier words inside a box then it will overflow!
  So to provide "Inner-Spacing" we will use "padding".
  IN SHORT: it means how much space an element takes up & how far it is away from model.
  IT is seen in computed area of "dev-tools" inside chrome browser.-->

<!--Padding is much better alternative than height and width because it arranges inside spacing on whatever text is present inside-->
<!--Vertical-align just aligns the buttons in this case is "top".-->
