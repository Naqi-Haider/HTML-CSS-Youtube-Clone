<!--button in style is CSS property
  and red is CSS value & color is for text not like text color or anything
  border for outline the button set to none means no black outlining
  "height" is measured for button height in px-> means pixels
  for rgb is actually clicking on color box for more specific color selection
  "r" for red "b" for blue and "g" for green 
  POINT TO REMEMBER: IF all values are set to 255,255,255 then it is White
  IF all values are set to 0,0,0 then it is Black-->
<!--"border-radius" is for rounder edges around the button the more pixels the more rounder it will be-->
<!-- for pointer cursor which changes the cursor shape when it is on button then "cursor" is Used -->
<!-- FOR button creation HTML is used and for professional Application to make the button more styled! CSS is Used-->
<!-- For each button css you have to specify the class. So for Subscribe button you have to specify the class which in this case
  is "subscribe-button" and then "button" in css will be replaced with .(class-name) it can be applied to various member buttons 
  or a single one! depending on the scenario so ::
   <button (class) = "class-name"> this class can be assigned same to all other buttons so then it will change according to that class
    behaviour or if it is assigned to single element then it will apply to that only button! -->

<!--Border-color shows the boundary color and it will apply the mix texture like light the top of button but dark at the bottom of the button
  So to solve this we are going to use border-style which is set to solid in this case. It means to apply the same texture to every border of the button means same color texture 
  all over the button (No mixing of/ Variation of color texture)-->

<!--Now for the thickness of the border of the button we can use "border-width". It uses pixels(px) to apply the effect the thinnes of boundary of a button.-->
<!--In CSS space actually means "margin". Now to provide space meaning margin between buttons we use "margin-right" for right space implementation of a button meaning in this case 
  to the right of subscribe button. -->

<!--To get the perfect Round-button we can apply the half-pixels for one of the lower pixels used in both height or width. If height is smaller then half of that height will be applied for 
  round-button which is border-radius pixels and if its width then so on.-->

<!--To apply the bold effect we use font-weight which is set to bold in this case. It is used in styling of font for button--->

<!-- Void elements are those which don't need closing for them. <link> does not have </link> 
 <link> provides to combine all css Style properties from a seperate file into the HTML code-->

<!-- <link> takes two attributes: "rel" for relation; what kind of thing we are relating to. In this case we are using "stylesheet" and "href" for that file like buttons.css-->
