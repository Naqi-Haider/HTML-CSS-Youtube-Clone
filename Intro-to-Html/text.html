<!-- "width" is used for providing newline property in between sentence, Usually it's not a good thing to do but 
  in this case it is pretty much required to get the desired output.-->
<!-- "line-height" is used to provide "spacing" between "words" so to adjust the proper spacing between "Texts", it is used!-->
<!-- HTML has several "entity" to provide special symbols such as "tick-mark" or "."-->
<!-- These special symbols can be used through googling stuff such as in this case the code &#183 is used for middle dot in HTML entity-->
<!-- <p> normally comes with a default margin spacing as you can normally dont use margin then it will provide margin whatsoever
    To avoid it we simply first remove this default margin spacing. To do this we use margin-bottom and margin-top to "0".-->

<!-- You can simply copy the symbol such as tick mark to be used in this code. Some browsers dont support this feature. We use HTML entity
 in this case!~-->

 <!--To remove the repetition or clean the code we will apply the font-family font-size which is same to all paragraphs in "p" in style!-->

 <!-- Now we can say that margin-bottom in "p" in style is set to zero but in case of class styling it is set to different value.
  How can we say that which effect is going to take place first? In this case there is something called:
  "CSS- Specificity". It means what is actually present behind the curly brackets0 { } in style; normally called "selector" !
  IN THIS CASE: the more specific the selector the more priority it gets from browser. In this case, "p" is general term and ".class-name" is more specific!
  So, it gets more priority than a general term. The class-selector has more specificity than a general term such paragraphs!-->

<!-- Text element is an element inside a text to provide its attributes.-->

<!-- <strong> element is inside the text to "bold" or highlight the text used inside the sentence.-->
<!-- Another element used is <u> which applies underlined property to the text used inside sentence.-->
<!-- <span> element is most generic text element. It has no prominable effect but it can be assigned with "class" thats the most useful part.-->

<!-- Now to apply multiple spaces between texts, We can use "class" style to provide margin-left or right features!.-->
